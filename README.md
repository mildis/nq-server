# Network Quality Server

## Welcome!
The _Network Quality Server_ project was created as a place to share example servers that can be used by the `networkQuality` command line tool available in macOS 12.

You can find a textual description of what a server needs to implement [here](SERVER_SPEC.md)

There’s also 2 complete reference server implementations, one written in [Swift](swift/README.md) and the other in [Go](https://github.com/network-quality/goserver).  Also provided are configurations for HTTP server/proxy servers: [Apache Traffic Server](trafficserver/README.md), [Apache HTTPD](httpd/README.md) and [nginx](nginx/README.md).

All the samples require an SSL certificate to run.

## Using networkQuality against your server
The `networkQuality` CLI takes a `-C` switch allowing you to point it at your server.

```
user@myhost ~ % networkQuality -C https://networkquality.example.com:8443/config
==== SUMMARY ====
Upload capacity: 29.662 Mbps
Download capacity: 541.622 Mbps
Upload flows: 12
Download flows: 12
Responsiveness: High (1825 RPM)
```

**NOTE**: The `networkQuality` CLI tool will only connect to a server presenting a valid SSL certificate. If you are using a custom CA, ensure the CA is trusted by the system.

There are more options available to affect behavior of this utility. See the manpage of `networkQuality` for more info.
